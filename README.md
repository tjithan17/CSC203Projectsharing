My Project is mainly a reskin of the original project, but there is a new event where you can spawn a legendary pokemon with a mouse click (after at least 1 team rocket spawns)
Then you can move the legendary with WASD. The goal of the legendary is to make it to a not full trainer to get caught while avoiding team rocket. Enjoy!
